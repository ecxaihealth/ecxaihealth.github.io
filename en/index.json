However, the effectiveness of various global model-centric and data-centric explanations in aiding domain experts to detect and resolve potential data issues for model improvement remains unexplored. This research investigates the influence of data-centric and model-centric global explanations in systems that support healthcare experts in optimising models through automated and manual data configurations. We conducted quantitative (n=70) and qualitative (n=30) studies with healthcare experts to explore the impact of different explanations on trust, understandability and model improvement. Our results reveal the insufficiency of global model-centric explanations for guiding users during data configuration. Although data-centric explanations enhanced understanding of post-configuration system changes, a hybrid fusion of both explanation types demonstrated the highest effectiveness. Based on our study results, we also present design implications for effective explanation-driven interactive machine-learning systems.","tags":["Interpretability","Machine Learning","Explanatory Interactive Learning","Human-centered AI","Model Steering"],"title":"EXMOS: Explanatory Model Steering Through Multifaceted Explanations and Data Configurations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Kopitar","Iztok Jr Fister","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1710201600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710201600,"objectID":"87191931fd7ee99eb2fece92e555561b","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/publication/08_infor_2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/08_infor_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major global health concern, but interpreting machine learning models for diagnosis remains challenging. This study investigates combining association rule mining with advanced natural language processing to improve both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. This novel approach has not been explored before in using pretrained transformers for diabetes classification on tabular data. Methods: The study used the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to investigate Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Python and Jupyter Notebook were employed for analysis, with the NiaARM framework for association rule mining. LightGBM and the dalex package were used for performance comparison and feature importance analysis, respectively. SHAP was used for local interpretability. OpenAI GPT version 3.5 was utilized for outcome prediction and interpretation. The source code is available on GitHub. Results: NiaARM generated 350 rules to predict diabetes. LightGBM performed better than the GPT-based model. A comparison of GPT and NiaARM rules showed disparities, prompting a similarity score analysis. LightGBM’s decision making leaned heavily on glucose, age, and BMI, as highlighted in feature importance rankings. Beeswarm plots demonstrated how feature values correlate with their influence on diagnosis outcomes. Discussion: Combining association rule mining with GPT for Type 2 diabetes mellitus classification yields limited effectiveness. Enhancements like preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning are required. Interpretation challenges and GPT’s dependency on provided rules indicate the necessity for prompt engineering and similarity score methods. Variations in feature importance rankings underscore the complexity of T2DM. Concerns regarding GPT’s reliability emphasize the importance of iterative approaches for improving prediction accuracy.","tags":["GPT","Association Rule Mining","Classification","Interpretability","Diagnostics"],"title":"Using Generative AI to Improve the Performance and Interpretability of Rule-Based Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nino Fijačko","Ruth Masterson Creber","Benjamin S.

This study aimed at estimating the daily physical activity and workload of nurses in a perioperative intensive care unit. The data sources for this study included data from the hospital information system on various procedures and interventions, and the Silva Ex3 Plus pedometers for measuring steps, kilometers, calories, and activity time across various shifts in a perioperative intensive care unit. Twenty nurses from Slovenia volunteered to participate in this observational study. Over 13 weeks, a nurse working an 8-hour shift walked an average of 5,938 steps (4.4 km). However, nurses who worked a 12-hour weekend day shift came very close to the World Health Organization’s recommendation with an average of 9,003 steps (6.5 km). A total of 227 patients were admitted and an average of 80 nursing interventions were performed per day and there was a positive relationship between physical activity, workload, and patient admissions in the perioperative intensive care unit (p = 0.001).

We used the AADE7 framework to assess the presence of self-care behavioural functions. uMARS scale was used to rate the overall quality of smartphone apps. Specifically, we identified 12 relevant apps and found that they included only 51 out of 88 possible behavioural features for self-care. In addition, most of the apps were rated as suboptimal in terms of inclusiveness, functionality, aesthetics and information. Based on the uMARS scoring scale, the average quality rating of the smartphone apps was 3.76.

Different people will respond to surveys in different ways. Some take the easy path and fill out the survey carelessly. The proportion of careless respondents determines the survey’s quality. As a result, identifying careless respondents is critical for the quality of obtained results. This study aims to explore the characteristics of careless respondents in survey data and evaluate the predictive power and interpretability of different types of data and indices of careless responding. The research question focuses on understanding the behavior of careless respondents and determining the effectiveness of various data sources in predicting their responses. Data from a three-month web-based survey on participants’ personality traits such as honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience was used in this study. Data for this study was taken from Schroeders et al.. The gradient boosting machine-based prediction model uses data from the answers, time spent for answering, demographic information on the respondents as well as some indices of careless responding from all three types of data. Prediction models were evaluated with tenfold cross-validation repeated a hundred times. Prediction models were compared based on balanced accuracy. Models’ explanations were provided with Shapley values. Compared with existing work, data fusion from multiple types of information had no noticeable effect on the performance of the gradient boosting machine model. Variables such as “I would never take a bribe, even if it was a lot”, average longstring, and total intra-individual response variability were found to be useful in distinguishing careless respondents. However, variables like “I would be tempted to use counterfeit money if I could get away with it” and intra-individual response variability of the first section of a survey showed limited effectiveness. Additionally, this study indicated that, whereas the psychometric synonym score has an immediate effect and is designed with the goal of identifying careless respondents when combined with other variables, it is not necessarily the optimal choice for fitting a gradient boosting machine model.","tags":["Careless Respondents","Questionnaire","Local Interpretability","Machine Learning"],"title":"Using heterogeneous sources of data and interpretability of prediction models to explain the characteristics of careless respondents in survey data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor Štiglic","Primož Kocbek","Pablo Meyer","Leon Kopitar","Lucija Gosak","Zhe He","Prithwish Chakraborty","Jiang Bian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691366400,"objectID":"509a2f93f2c9c1ba74e33694a200e204","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/publication/05_dshealth_2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/05_dshealth_2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Primary care professionals struggle to keep up to date with the latest scientific literature critical in guiding evidence-based practice related to their daily work. To help solve the above-mentioned problem, we employed generative artificial intelligence techniques based on large-scale language models to summarize abstracts of scientific papers. Our objective is to investigate the potential of generative artificial intelligence in diminishing the cognitive load experienced by practitioners, thus exploring its ability to alleviate mental effort and burden. The study participants were provided with two use cases related to preventive care and behavior change, simulating a search for new scientific literature. The study included 113 university students from Slovenia and the United States randomized into three distinct study groups. The first group was assigned to the full abstracts. The second group was assigned to the short abstracts generated by AI. The third group had the option to select a full abstract in addition to the AI-generated short summary. Each use case study included ten retrieved abstracts. Our research demonstrates that the use of generative AI for literature review is efficient and effective. The time needed to answer questions related to the content of abstracts was significantly lower in groups two and three compared to the first group using full abstracts.

Such a disruptive technology could significantly reduce the time required for healthcare professionals to keep up with the most recent scientific literature; nevertheless, further developments are needed to help them comprehend the knowledge accurately.","tags":["Healthcare","Summarization","Artificial Intelligence","Large Language Models"],"title":"Improving primary healthcare workflow using extreme summarization of scientific literature based on generative AI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nino Fijačko","Robert Greif","Gregor Štiglic","Primož Kocbek","Benjamin S.

However, little research has compared the utility of different explanation methods in guiding healthcare experts for patient care. Moreover, it is unclear how useful, understandable, actionable and trustworthy these methods are for healthcare experts, as they often require technical ML knowledge. This paper presents an explanation dashboard that predicts the risk of diabetes onset and explains those predictions with data-centric, feature-importance, and example-based explanations. We designed an interactive dashboard to assist healthcare experts, such as nurses and physicians, in monitoring the risk of diabetes onset and recommending measures to minimize risk. We conducted a qualitative study with 11 healthcare experts and a mixed-methods study with 45 healthcare experts and 51 diabetic patients to compare the different explanation methods in our dashboard in terms of understandability, usefulness, actionability, and trust. Results indicate that our participants preferred our representation of data-centric explanations that provide local explanations with a global overview over other methods. Therefore, this paper highlights the importance of visually directive data-centric explanation method for assisting healthcare experts to gain actionable insights from patient health records. Furthermore, we share our design implications for tailoring the visual representation of different explanation methods for healthcare experts.","tags":["Healthcare","Visual Analytics","Explainable AI"],"title":"Directive Explanations for Monitoring the Risk of Diabetes Onset: Introducing Directive Data-Centric Explanations and Combinations to Support What-If Explorations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leona Cilar Budler","Lucija Gosak","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673308800,"objectID":"4959e0d7426f383ebca3b9edcd1b4558","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/publication/01_wires_2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/01_wires_2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Use of conversational agents, like chatbots, avatars, and robots is increasing worldwide. Yet, their effectiveness in health care is largely unknown. The aim of this advanced review was to assess the use and effectiveness of conversational agents in various fields of health care. A literature search, analysis, and synthesis were conducted in February 2022 in PubMed and CINAHL. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. We reviewed articles on artificial intelligence-based question-answering systems in health care. Most of the identified articles report its effectiveness; less is known about its use. We outlined study findings and explored directions of future research, to provide evidence-based knowledge about artificial intelligence-based question-answering systems.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","Conversational Agents","ChatGPT","Health Care","Machine Learning"],"title":"Review of artificial intelligence-based question-answering systems in healthcare","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/contact/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Main host institution: KU Leuven\nSupervisor: Katrien Verbert (Informatics Section, KU Leuven)\nForeign host institution: University of Maribor\nSupervisor: Gregor Štiglic (FHS, University of Maribor)\nProject reference in the Slovenian Current Research Information System (SICRIS): here\nSummary\nThe field of artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied in the healthcare sector, where the latest techniques rely on machine learning. The challenge of understanding these models remains. The use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can make such models more understandable to the end-user. In this project, we aim to use Explainable Artificial Intelligence to enable end-users to explain and justify the predictions and recommendations obtained. In doing so, we will focus primarily on more general, broad, and flexible explanations.\nThis is to enable healthcare professionals to understand the reasoning behind the model used. This would have an impact on both acceptance and confidence in the model. In this project, we will investigate the effectiveness of using conversational explanatory interfaces that are able to explain model decisions in dialogue with the end-user. Finally, we want to investigate how explanations can be tailored to the end-user.\nThe project will be based on an empirical approach in which we will investigate how users interact with the explanatory interface and assess the impact of explanatory methods on model understanding and user confidence. The data collection will involve ten healthcare centers in Slovenia, where we will apply the XAI methods developed in this project.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"67d9d5c6a0dfed2f80ac622426a6a91d","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/project/fwo-aris_2023-26/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/fwo-aris_2023-26/","section":"project","summary":"Main host institution: KU Leuven\nSupervisor: Katrien Verbert (Informatics Section, KU Leuven)\nForeign host institution: University of Maribor\nSupervisor: Gregor Štiglic (FHS, University of Maribor)\nProject reference in the Slovenian Current Research Information System (SICRIS): here","tags":["Interpretability","Prediction Models","Visual Analytics","Large Language Models"],"title":"Enriched conversational XAI methods for healthcare","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/people/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/en/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
